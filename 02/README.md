Task1: 
1. Two signed integer 4-byte numbers and two positions of bits i and j, where i<=j, are given. 
   Implement the "InsertNumber" algorithm to insert bits from the j-th to the i-th bit of the second number to the first so that 
   the bits of the second number take positions from the j bit to i (bits numbered from right to left). 
2. Develop Nunit and MS Unit tests of the method.

Task2:
1. Implement method FindNextBiggerNumber, that takes positive integer number and returns the nearest bigger integer number, 
   consisting of the digits of original number, and -1 or null in the case such a number doesn't exist.
2. Develop NUnit or MS Unit tests of the method.

Task3:
1. Add an ability to return time, needed to find the number, to the method FindNextBiggerNumber.
2. Develop NUnit or MS Unit tests of the method.

Task4:
1. Implement method FilterDigit, that takes a list of integers and filters it so that only numbers containing target digit are left. DO NOT USE LINQ!
2. Develop NUnit or MS Unit tests of the method.

Task5:
1. Implement the FindNthRoot algorithm, which allows to calculate the n-th root (n∈N) of number a (a∈R) by the Newton method with a given accuracy.
2. Develop NUnit or MS Unit tests of the method.
