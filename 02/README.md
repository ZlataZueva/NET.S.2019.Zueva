Task1: 
1. Two integer signed four byte numbers and two positions of bits i and j, where i<=j, are given. 
   Implement the "InsertNumber" algorithm to insert bits from the j-th to the i-th bit of the second number to the first so that 
   the bits of the second number take positions from the j bit to i (bits numbered from right to left). 
2. Develop Nunit and MS Unit tests of the method.
