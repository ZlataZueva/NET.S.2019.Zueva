Tasks1:

1.Implement an immutable Polynomial class for working with polynomials from one variable (use the sz-array as the internal structure for storing coefficients).
For developed class:
a)override the virtual methods of the Object class;
b}overload operations allowed for working with polynomials (except the division of a polynomial by a polynomial), including == and !=.
2.Add unit tests.

Task2:

1.Implement a bubble sort algorithm for jagged integer arrays (do not use sorting methods of the System.Array class), so that it would be possible to order the rows of the matrix:
in ascending (descending) order by sum of matrix row elements;
in ascending (descending) order of maximum elements of matrix rows;
in ascending (descending) order of minimum elements of matrix rows;
2.Add unit tests.
